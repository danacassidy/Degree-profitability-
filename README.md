# Degree-profitability-
Comparing degrees via WSJ data using pandas, streamlit, and more. I created this project from scratch and found the datatset on Kaggle.
Streamlit allows for users to view the downloaded file live. In order to view it, download the file, then run it in terminal with "streamlit run (insert file name)". It should redirect the user to a live, interactive version.
